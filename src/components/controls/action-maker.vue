    <h1 id="ens-dao-constitution">ENS DAO Constitution</h1>
    <p>
      The ENS constitution is a set of binding rules that determine what
      governance actions are legitimate for the DAO to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each article has examples of permissible and non permissible actions.
      These examples are illustrative and should not be considered a binding
      part of the text of the constitution itself.
    </p>
    <h2 id="i-name-ownership-shall-not-be-infringed">
      I. Name ownership shall not be infringed
    </h2>
    <p>
      ENS governance will not enact any change that infringes on the rights of
      ENS users to retain names they own, or unfairly discriminate against name
      owners’ ability to extend, transfer, or otherwise use their names.
    </p>
    <h3 id="-examples-"><strong>Examples</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Permissible</strong>: ENS governance may enact a change affecting
      the registration or extension costs of all names based on transparent
      criteria such as length, as long as it pursues a goal outlined in this
      constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Not Permissible</strong>: ENS governance must not enact a change
      increasing or reducing the extension costs of a list of existing ENS
      names, as this would unfairly benefit or penalise a handpicked group.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ii-fees-are-primarily-an-incentive-mechanism">
      II. Fees are primarily an incentive mechanism
    </h2>
    <p>
      The primary purpose of registration fees is as an incentive mechanism to
      prevent the namespace becoming overwhelmed with speculatively registered
      names. A secondary purpose is to provide enough revenue to the DAO to fund
      ongoing development and improvement of ENS. ENS governance will not enact
      any fee other than for these purposes.
    </p>
    <h3 id="-examples-"><strong>Examples</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Permissible</strong>: ENS governance may increase the price of
      name registrations in order to address excessive speculative registrations
      induced by a price that is set too low, or because the current price is
      insufficient to fund ongoing ENS operations at a reasonable level.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Not Permissible</strong>: ENS governance must not enact a change
      imposing a fee for claiming DNS domains inside ENS, because such a fee
      would be purely an income generating measure and not an incentive
      mechanism.
    </p>
    <h2 id="iii-income-funds-ens-and-other-public-goods">
      III. Income funds ENS and other public goods
    </h2>
    <p>
      Any income generated to the ENS treasury is to be used first of all to
      ensure the long-term viability of ENS, and to fund continuing development
      and improvement of the ENS system. Funds that are not reasonably required
      to achieve this goal may be used to fund other public goods within web3 as
      ENS governance sees fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENS governance will not allocate funds to a team or individual who does
      not commit to uphold the same principles outlined in this constitution in
      their use of the allocated funds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="-examples-"><strong>Examples</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Permissible</strong>: ENS governance may offer grant funding for a
      public good unrelated to ENS or Ethereum, so long as doing so does not
      affect the long-term viability of ENS.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Not Permissible</strong>: ENS governance must not use the funds to
      support projects that conflict with the goals of ENS.
    </p>
    <h2 id="iv-ens-integrates-with-the-global-namespace">
      IV. ENS Integrates with the global namespace
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to facilitate making the most widely usable naming system, ENS
      aims to integrate with the legacy DNS naming system to the greatest extent
      possible without sacrificing decentralization of ENS. ENS governance will
      not enact changes that compromise ENS’s ability to do this.
    </p>
    <h3 id="-examples-"><strong>Examples</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Permissible</strong>: ENS governance should grant control of a
      top-level domain to its owner in the DNS system on request.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Not permissible</strong>: ENS governance must not create new
      top-level domains unless those domains have been granted to ENS by a DNS
      authority.
    </p>
    <h2 id="v-amendments-to-this-constitution-by-majority-vote">
      V. Amendments to this constitution by majority vote
    </h2>
    <p>
      Any change may be made to this constitution only by two-thirds majority
      and at least 1% of all tokens participating.
